        <p>Diabetes is a condition where the amount of glucose in your blood is too high because the body cannot use it properly.

        This is because your pancreas doesn’t produce any insulin, or not enough insulin, to help glucose enter your body’s cells – or the insulin that is produced does not work properly (known as insulin resistance).
        Insulin is the hormone produced by the pancreas that allows glucose to enter the body’s cells, where it is used as fuel for energy so we can work, play and generally live our lives. It is vital for life.
        Glucose comes from digesting carbohydrate and is also produced by the liver.
        If you have diabetes, your body cannot make proper use of this glucose so it builds up in the blood and can’t be used as fuel.
        There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes.</p>

        <h2>How do I manage my Diabetes?</h2>
        <p>Effective diabetes care can only be achieved through working closely with your diabetes healthcare team – they are there to support you in self-managing your diabetes.
        The most important person in the team is you – because the decisions made will affect you. Taking responsibility for your diabetes will enable you to manage your diabetes more effectively.
        Ask questions and request more information if you need to.</p>
